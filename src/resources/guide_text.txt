                What happens to the feedback (Portal entry and responses from The Senior Team)
                Meeting duration (one hour)
                Seek to Understand: Mandatory and freeform questions (M = Mandatory)
                What’s good about working at BHX4 - What do you enjoy about it? [M]
                What could be better? [M]
                2 x ’Seek to understand’ questions around low scoring Connections scores related to the AM conducting the 1:5 meeting. [M]
                Minimum of 1 x ’Seek to understand’ question around low scoring Connections score related to the building. [M]
                Free Form Discussion/Questions: Topics and questions chosen by the AM that reflect things that are happening right now - or are about to happen that may/are affecting the mood of the team; such as recently announced policy changes, operational and facilities/building changes. It would also be an opportunity to gather pole/survey data and to correct rumours circulating among the greater team that have come to the attention of the ER Teams.
                If there is one thing that you would change here at BHX4, what would it be? (Consensus question - answer to be agreed by the whole/majority of the group). [M]
